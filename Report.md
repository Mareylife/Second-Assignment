## Intruction
In this assignment, i built a simple Java application that connects to a weather API and retrieves information about the current weather conditions of a given city.
On this assignment i learned:
- How to import and use a JSON library by reading its documentation
- Parse and process JSON data in Java
- Understanded how the `getWeatherData()` function works and makes HTTP requests to retrieve data from the weather API
- Use Git for version control and collaborate on a codebase
- Use Maven or Gradle as package manager
- Write a report on the assignment

## Design and Implementation
I used Java-Gradle and Json library to solve this exercise.
On https://www.weatherapi.com/, there was an example of Jason I was working with. I started to write the algorithm for calculating the required value.
I defined two functions for each request. One to calculate the requested value and one to print it correctly.
Finally, I combined some printing functions to comply with the principles of clean code.

## Testing and Evaluation
For testing process, i entered the name of a city as an input. In this case, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction should be displayed as output.
